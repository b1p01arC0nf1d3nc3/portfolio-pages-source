## How to play and enjoy Backdoors and Breaches

Backdoors and Breaches is a fantastic incident response activity that challenges participants to solve a multi-faceted cyber incident by making decisions and watching everything go wrong (well, at least some of the time).

The activity if free to try and is made by the fabulous folks over at Black Hills Information Security, who can be found [here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/). Amazingly, the activity is even hosted online for all to use, and the web version makes it easy to host a remote session without requiring extensive preparation (you can find out more about the different ways to play [here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/projects/backdoorsandbreaches/)).

In terms of how the activity works, the incident responders (the participants) have 10 rounds to try and deal with the incident before it becomes too impactful. They need to discuss what they would like to and prioritize remediatory actions to attempt a full resolution. They can use procedure cards, such as SIEM log analysis and network threat hunting, to try and uncover one of the four elements of the incident. If the team successfully manage to uncover all four elements of the incident in time then they have handled the incident. There are a few other rules which can significantly affect play, and the main rules are summarized below.

## Rules
- Work as a team to discover all 4 cards to respond to the incident.
- 10 rounds to discover all 4 event cards.
- Actions can be chosen from the procedure cards. Actions must be reached via consensus (can also ask for specific clarification from the incident leader).
- A dice roll is made to determine if an action is successful or not. 11 and over is a success, while 10 and below is a failure. There is a 3-round cooldown after using a card to prevent the same card being used repeatedly.
- An 'inject' card is added on a roll of 1 or 20, or after 3 consecutive failures. Inject cards add a random element to the game and can be positive or very destructive. These cards often lead to the most significant learning as participants are forced to react quickly to the change.

Though not necessarily a rule, the following are recommendations to get more out of the experience:
- After a failure, ask for why that might have happened. Participants will often be able to give a justification for you, especially if they know of a weakness in their environment. The failure could, for example, be due to resource constraints, human errors, or policy changes.
- After the game, go through and assess if what happened was realistic. Participants will generally respond with a Yes, No, or Maybe. **Always** clarify Maybe. The time spent clarifying is well worth it due to the extra insight participants will get into their environment and you will also learn how to make the activity more representative next time.
- Allow for unique elements and changes to rules. The rules are a solid framework, but as the incident leader you have the ability to incorporate the suggestions and ideas of the participants to make the activity more successful. This could include revealing a slight hint due to the specificity of what the participants attempt to do, adding the ability to call a consultant if it fits the overall narrative, or guaranteeing a success for a procedure that the participants show excellence in.

The way the activity is run by the incident leader obviously has a large impact on the success of the activity, but it is also important to get participants to buy in to the activity in the early stages by adding humor or appealing to what they are looking for. As a member of a cybersecurity club, this has often revolved around incorporation of our mascot: a hacking goose. This goose has been added to a range of different companies, and I always try my best to try and make a logo that includes the mascot and a slightly altered company name. This hopefully not only prompts a smile, but also sets the context for where the incident and the activity take place.

From the chances I've had to lead this activity, I can definitely vouch for its applicability to various groups in the cyber space. It has been a great tool for students as it allows them to apply the knowledge they are gaining throughout whatever course they may be doing to an activity where they are forced to justify decisions. Talking through options help reinforce learning and builds a degree of confidence when sharing this kind of information with those less focused on cyber. I can also see the value it would hold for incident response teams at different organizations, who would benefit from the opportunity to review incident response plans and identify areas that might be a bit foggy, thus prompting them to clarify procedures and communication trees to enable them to effectively respond to incidents.

If you can, I wholeheartedly recommend trying the activity out. If you want some tips, check out the video provided by BHIS to find out more.
