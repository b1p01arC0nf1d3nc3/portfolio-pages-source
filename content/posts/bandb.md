# How to play and enjoy Backdoors and Breaches

Backdoors and Breaches is a fantastic incident response activity that challenges participants to solve a multi-faceted cyber incident by making decisions and watching everything go wrong (well, at least some of the time).

The activity if free to try and is made by the fabulous folks over at Blackhills Security.

# Rules: 
- Work as a team to discover all 4 cards to respond to the incident.
- 10 rounds to discover all 4 event cards.
- Actions can be chosen from the procedure cards. Actions must be reached via consensus (can also ask for specific clarification).
- Roll for a successful action. 11 and over is a success. 3-round cooldown after using a card.
- Inject on 1, 20, and 3 straight failures.
- After a failure, ask for why that might have happened.
- After the game, go through and assess if what happened was realistic. Yes, No, or Maybe. Always clarify Maybe.
