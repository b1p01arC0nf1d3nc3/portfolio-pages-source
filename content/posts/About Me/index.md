## Bio
Current cybersecurity student with a background in teaching looking to explore and learn more about threat hunting, red teaming, and incident response.

First fell in love with technology as a youngster by being enthralled by the speed of a blue hedgehog darting about a screen (an excellent distraction device employed by family). Since then, have taken a roundabout journey into tech and currently working towards getting certified in the area of penetration testing.

The aspect of giving back to the community in this field really appeals to me, and I look forward to sharing discoveries on my way with those already in the field and those like me who are finding their path into it.
